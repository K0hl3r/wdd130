      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose is to add to my business with a website based portfolio for my Illustrations. I have a distinct art style and I would like to get it out to more people besides my audience on instagram. This will help my business seem more professional and seem better in quality. I will show digital art, traditional art (ink, pencil), etc.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience will be those looking for artist to work with. I want to create comic books one day and hope that this website will get out to those who are looking for comic illustrators. That dosent have to be the only audience however, this website could also show off my art to those who are looking to enjoy my art in general, kind of like an art museum of sort.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This portfolio website, as I said before, will be considered a museum of a sort, and every museum needs an entrance to get its audience excited for what is to come. This Home Page will act as the entry way to my art museum and welcome my audience. Whether they be looking for illustrators for hire, looking for commission illustrations, or they just want to look at the drawings, this Home page will lead them to where they need to go. We will start at the top at the navigation bar where the audience will find my logo and links to page 2 Traditional Drawings, page 3 Digital Drawings, and a contact page. I will have a Hero photo depicting a collage of my artwork and underneath that there will be some text welcoming the audience to the website. Scrolling past the welcoming paragraph there will be two photos, one depicting one of my more recent traditional styled illustrations and the other will depict one of my more recent digital styled illustrations. Both pictures will also act as links leading to their individual pages. Below that there will be a brief text box saying when I will be open for commission and of course a footer with copyright info, contact info, and social media links.

        <img src="images/Jazz Wakes Up.jpg" alt="image for homepage" width="230" height="230">

      </ul>
      <h3>Traditional Drawings</h3>
      <p>
        Page 2 will be used to show off my traditional drawings. Traditional drawing indicates that the illustrations will be using a physical medium of art such as, pencil, ink pen, marker, paint, etc. My style of drawing consists of mainly cartoon illustrations so we will focus on that. At the top, much like the home page, we will have the navigation bar with the logo and links from before. Below this we will see a title for the page that will tell the audience which page they clicked into; we will also have a quick summary of what traditional drawings are. After this paragraph we will scroll to see a section of the page titled Pencil, this of course will display only pencil drawing/sketches, this will show what I can do quickly as sketches donâ€™t really take up too much time, there will be approximately 5 of these sketches. If we keep scrolling down, we will find the next section titled Ink, this is where I will show off my most recent pen/marker drawings, the audience will get to see what happens if I take sketches one step further, again there will be 5 recent drawings. If someone decides to click on one of these drawings, they will be able to get a closer look. Finally, we scroll down to the footer from before and that will conclude page 2.

      </ul>
      <h3>Digital Drawings</h3>
      <p>
        Page 3 will be used to show off my digital drawings. Digital drawings are the type of drawings that can come from apps like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrate, Pro-create, MediBang Paint Pro, etc. Again, my style is still cartooning illustrations, so that will be showed off here as well. This page will be fairly similar to the Traditional Drawings page. Like all other pages we will start with the navigation bar with all of its bells and whistles and then the title of the page. We then scroll down to the description of digital drawings and what they have to offer. This text will also describe what I can do professionally, as digital drawings are considered the most clean and professional now a days. We will scroll down to a section that is titled Linework, this will show off 5 drawings without any color (think coloring book before a kid gets their hands on it) and it will show how clean my linework can be. The next section will be titled color, this will show 5 drawings with the color filled in, the audience will be able to gleam how I use color theory, lighting, shadows, and backgrounds. At the end we will see the last instance of the footer.
