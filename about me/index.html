    <p>Hello, it is nice to be here in this online class. As you can see my name is Kohler Pratt. I am from Arizona, and let me be the millionth one to say yes, it is hot here.</p>
    <p>I will be studying web and computer design as I aim to get a degree in professional studies. I figured that it was about time to go back to school and what better then studying at BYU I Online. </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church for my entire life. I served my mission in the Farmington New Mexico mission and I love Jesus Christ. Some of my hobbies include drawing, cooking, and playing video games.</p>
    <p>I am grateful to be apart of this class and I am excited for this semester. I can tell it will be a great expirence!</p>
